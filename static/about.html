  Hello! My name is Aljon Pineda. I am 17 years old, turning 18 in August.
  I recently graduated from Meadowcreek High School, and I will be attending
  Georgia Tech and majoring in Computer Science. I have one younger sister;
  she is 16 right now.<br><br>

  My family is from the Philippines, but I was born in Staten Island, New York.
  I was raised as a Catholic, and I attended a Catholic private school
  until I moved to a public school in the 3rd grade
  since it was closer to my home. In the 4th grade,
  I discovered my interest of playing instruments, making music,
  and being a part of the band. It wasn't until the summer of 2009
  that I moved here to Georgia. And even though there wasn't a band for me
  to join, I got the chance to play the guitar in the 5th grade.<br><br>

  I joined the band when I moved on to middle school, and all three years,
  I played the trumpet. My parents also enrolled me
  to get private piano lessons, but I stopped in the 8th grade because
  I enjoyed band much more than the piano.
  When I moved on to Meadowcreek High School, I joined the marching band and
  had a blast being a part of it. But in the end,
  I decided to quit after my freshman year,
  but I still hope that I could get back to playing the trumpet,
  probably as a hobby, since I miss those fun days.
  However, with that out of my mind, I discovered my other interest
  with computer science and programming, and I ended up becoming the
  Chief Editor of the Meadowcreek High School website in my senior year
  and an ambassador for the School of Information Technology.<br><br>

  I also enjoy doing community service. Every summer during my
  high school years, I would participate in a week-long program that
  my church was doing called Mission, where each day, we would dispatch
  to various work sites around the community,
  including Camp Hollywood and FODAC. Then, we would come back together
  to share our experiences and have fun at a group outing.
